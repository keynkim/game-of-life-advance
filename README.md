Game of Life Advance brings John Conway’s classic cellular automaton to the Game Boy Advance. Watch as simple patterns evolve into intricate, dynamic behaviour based on four starting configurations:

- Random Pattern – A chaotic, unpredictable start.
- Three Unique Patterns – Crafted setups that unfold in surprising ways. 

You can play it on actual Game Boy Advance hardware or through emulation.
